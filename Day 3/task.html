                <p>This article is about the country. For other uses, see Nepal (disambiguation). <br> Nepal,<sup
                        style="color: blue;">[a]</sup> officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal,<sup
                        style="color: blue;">[b]</sup> is a landlocked country in South Asia. It is mainly situated in
                    the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous
                    Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated
                    from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a
                    diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten
                    tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's
                    capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, and
                    multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.</p>
                <p>The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian subcontinent, the era
                    in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant religion of the country. In the middle
                    of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern
                    Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located
                    Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous
                    Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was
                    dominated by the valley's traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and
                    architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah
                    dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under
                    its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between
                    Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice
                    suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005. The Nepalese Civil War in the 1990s and early
                    2000s resulted in the establishment of a secular republic in 2008, ending the world's last Hindu
                    monarchy. The Constitution of Nepal, adopted in 2015, affirms the country as a federal parliamentary
                    republic divided into seven provinces. Nepal was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and
                    friendship treaties were signed with India in 1950 and China in 1960. Nepal hosts the permanent
                    secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), of which it is a
                    founding member. Nepal is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bay of Bengal
                    Initiative.</p>

                <p>Main article: Name of Nepal</p>
                <p>Before the unification of Nepal, the Kathmandu Valley was known as Nepal.<sup
                        style="color: blue;">[c]</sup> The precise origin of the term Nepāl is uncertain. Nepal appears
                    in ancient Indian literary texts dated as far back as the fourth century AD.<sup
                        style="color: blue;">[16]</sup>An absolute chronology can not be established, as even the oldest
                    texts may contain anonymous contributions dating as late as the early modern period. Academic
                    attempts to provide a plausible theory are hindered by the lack of a complete picture of history and
                    insufficient understanding of linguistics or relevant Indo-European and Tibeto-Burman languages.</p>
                <p>According to Hindu mythology, Nepal derives its name from an ancient Hindu sage called Ne, referred
                    to variously as Ne Muni or Nemi. According to Pashupati Purāna, as a place protected by Ne, the
                    country in the heart of the Himalayas came to be known as Nepāl.<sup
                        style="color: blue;">[18]</sup><sup style="color: blue;">[a]</sup><sup>[19]</sup> According to
                    Nepāl Mahātmya<sup style="color: blue;">[e]</sup> Nemi was charged with protection of the country by
                    Pashupati.<sup style="color: blue;">[20]</sup>According to Buddhist mythology, Manjushri Bodhisattva
                    drained a primordial lake of serpents to create the Nepal valley and proclaimed that Adi-Buddha Ne
                    would take care of the community that would settle it. As the cherished of Ne, the valley would be
                    called Nepāl.<sup>[21]</sup> According to Gopalarājvamshāvali, the genealogy of ancient Gopala
                    dynasty compiled c. 1380s, Nepal is named after Nepa the cowherd, the founder of the Nepali scion of
                    the Abhiras. In this account, the cow that issued milk to the spot, at which Nepa discovered the
                    Jyotirlinga of Pashupatināth upon investigation, was also named Ne.<sup>[17]</sup>/p>
                <p>The Ne Muni etymology was rightly dismissed by the early European visitors.<sup
                        style="color: blue;">[22]</sup> Norwegian indologist Christian Lassen proposed that Nepāla was a
                    compound of Nipa (foot of a mountain) and -ala (short suffix for alaya meaning abode), and so Nepāla
                    meant "abode at the foot of the mountain".[23] Indologist Sylvain Levi found Lassen's theory
                    untenable but had no theories of his own, only suggesting that either Newara is a vulgarism of
                    sanskritic Nepala, or Nepala is Sanskritisation of the local ethnic;<sup>[24]</sup> his view has
                    found some support though it does not answer the question of
                    etymology.<sup>[25]</sup><sup>[26]</sup><sup>[27]</sup><sup>[17]</sup> It has also been proposed
                    that Nepa is a Tibeto-Burman stem consisting of Ne (cattle) and Pa (keeper), reflecting the fact
                    that early inhabitants of the valley were Gopalas (cowherds) and Mahispalas (buffalo-herds).<sup
                        style="color: blue;">[17]</sup> Suniti Kumar Chatterji believed Nepal originated from
                    Tibeto-Burman roots – Ne, of uncertain meaning (as multiple possibilities exist), and pala or bal,
                    whose meaning is lost entirely.<sup style="color: blue;">[28]</sup></p>

                <h3>Ancient Nepal</h3>
                <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa,
                    where they had earlier evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia
                    date to about 30,000 years ago.[32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human
                    settlements in Nepal dates to around the same time.[33]</p>
                <p>After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent
                    structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
                    Balochistan.[34] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[35][34] the first
                    urban culture in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins
                    have been discovered in the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern
                    Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to be people from the Indus Valley Civilisation. It is
                    possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian
                    subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other ethnic groups like the
                    Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[38] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese people had
                    reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or
                    both.[39] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians,
                    who were in Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the
                    valley of Kathmandu.[40]</p>
                <p>By the late Vedic period, Nepal was being mentioned in various Hindu texts, such as the late Vedic
                    Atharvaveda Pariśiṣṭa and in the post-Vedic Atharvashirsha Upanishad.[41] The Gopal Bansa was the
                    oldest dynasty to be mentioned in various texts as the earliest rulers of the central Himalayan
                    kingdom known by the name 'Nepal'.[42] The Gopalas were followed by Kiratas who ruled for over 16
                    centuries by some accounts.[43] According to the Mahabharata, the then Kirata king went to take part
                    in the Battle of Kurukshetra. In the south-eastern region, Janakpurdham was the capital of the
                    prosperous kingdom of Videha or Mithila, that extended down to the Ganges, and home to King Janaka
                    and his daughter, Sita.</p>
                <p>Around 600 BC, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal.
                    From one of these, the Shakya polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an
                    ascetic life, founded Buddhism, and came to be known as Gautama Buddha (traditionally dated 563–483
                    BC).[44] Nepal came to be established as a land of spirituality and refuge in the intervening
                    centuries, played an important role in transmitting Buddhism to East Asia via Tibet,[45] and helped
                    preserve Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts.</p>
                <p>By 250 BC, the southern regions had come under the influence of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka
                    made a pilgrimage to Lumbini and erected a pillar at Buddha's birthplace, the inscriptions on which
                    mark the starting point for properly recorded history of Nepal.[46] Ashoka also visited the
                    Kathmandu valley and built monuments commemorating Gautama Buddha's visit there. By the 4th century
                    AD, much of Nepal was under the influence of the Gupta Empire.[f][47]</p>
                <p>In the Kathmandu valley, the Kiratas were pushed eastward by the Licchavis, and the Licchavi dynasty
                    came into power c. 400 AD. The Lichchhavis built monuments and left a series of inscriptions;
                    Nepal's history of the period is pieced together almost entirely from them.[48][45] In 641, Songtsen
                    Gampo of the Tibetan Empire sends Narendradeva back to Licchavi with an army and subjugates Nepal.
                    Parts of Nepal and Licchavi was later under the direct influences of the Tibetan empire.[49] The
                    Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century and was followed by a Thakuri rule.
                    Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 11th century AD; not much is known of
                    this period that is often called the dark period.[50]</p>
